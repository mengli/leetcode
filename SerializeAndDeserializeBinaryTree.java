/**
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 *
 * Example: 
 *
 * You may serialize the following tree:
 *
 *   1
 *  / \
 * 2   3
 *    / \
 *   4   5
 *
 * as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
